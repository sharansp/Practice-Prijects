Sadguru:
   Faith works for those who are simple minded
   What is not happened till today, can happen tomorrow
   Peaceful, Loving and Joyful world
   
   No fool like young fool
   -->Fishihng story
   unless you do the right things , won't happen to you
   
   Everything happens within you!
   
   “The greatest thing that you can do in life is to live to your peak and to set an example that there is a way to live beyond all limitations.”










Vaibhav: 
	#You should not ask before trying!
	#Prove yourself
	
Sadguru
	#Coming to sense is not resolution!!
	
	#As cobras and other creatures shed their old skin, this time of year offers us the possibility to shed our old nonsense and experience a new beginning. 

	#In this message for the new year, Sadhguru asks, do you have the courage to make something happen which is larger than yourself?
