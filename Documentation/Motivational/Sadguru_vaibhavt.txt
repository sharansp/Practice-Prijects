Vaibhav: 
	#You should not ask before trying!
	#Prove yourself
	
Sadguru
	#Coming to sense is not resolution!!
	
	#As cobras and other creatures shed their old skin, this time of year offers us the possibility to shed our old nonsense and experience a new beginning. 

	#In this message for the new year, Sadhguru asks, do you have the courage to make something happen which is larger than yourself?
